A pre-interview take home assignment for PrinterLogic. The assignment is to write a basic automated test suite for the login page of https://rubixdesign.printercloud.com/admin/ using Selenium.

Necessary packages:

Selenium:

pip install selenium

A WebDriver such as ChromeDriver:
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
(I installed chromium-chromedriver through the Synaptic Package Manager in Linux)

To run, simply run test_engine.py in the main folder.
